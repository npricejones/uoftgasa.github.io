# The Comprehensive Guide to Graduate School

## Introduction

Welcome to graduate school at UofT's Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics! We (the current graduate students) have written this guide to try and help you through all of the administrative details so you can get straight to your research. If you like, you can skip ahead to our suggested [to-do list](#new-student-to-do-list) for new students, or use the table of contents on the left to navigate to the appropriate section (note that the table of contents is not currently available on small screens).

This is a living document, you can contribute to its creation by forking the [uoftgasa](https://github.com/uoftgasa/uoftgasa.github.io) repository.

All astronomy graduate students at UofT are officially affiliated with the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics (DAA), primarily spread across two buildings, the [Astronomy Building](#astronomy-building) and the 12th, 13th and 14th floors of the [Burton Tower attached to McLennan Physical Labs](#mclennan-physical-labs-and-burton-tower). 

### Dunlap Institute

[Website](http://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca)

The Dunlap Institute (Dunlap) is primarily focused on advancing instrumentation-based research and improving scientific outreach. Dunlap members (professors and post-docs) are located in the [Astronomy Building](#astronomy-building). Graduate students can become affiliated with the Dunlap if they are supervised by a Dunlap professor. These students can apply for additional funding not available to the rest of their cohort and are invited to Dunlap specific events like holiday parties and the 3 day Dunlap Retreat.

### Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics

[Website](https://www.cita.utoronto.ca)

The Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics (CITA) focuses on theoretical work CITA is located on the 13th and 14th floors of the [Burton Tower attached to McLennan Physical Labs](#mclennan-physical-labs-and-burton-tower).

### Centre for Planetary Sciences

### School of Graduate Studies

The School of Graduate Studies (SGS) sends out frequent emails with the many workshops and events they run for graduate students, which are primarily located in [Grad Room](http://www.sgs.utoronto.ca/currentstudents/Pages/Grad-Room.aspx) at the base of Grad House on the corner of Harbord Street and Spadina Ave. These events range from career focused to subsidized trips.

The SGS also maintains the [Graduate Centre for Academic Communication](http://www.sgs.utoronto.ca/currentstudents/Pages/GCAC.aspx), which runs workshops and courses on academic communication as well as one-on-one writing consultations. This is an excellent service; with enough advance notice they will help you edit your writing to make it truly excellent.

In addition, the SGS offers many courses to help you enhance skills that may not be explicitly taught elsewhere. These courses are offered under the umbrella of the [Graduate Professional Skills Program](http://www.sgs.utoronto.ca/currentstudents/Pages/Professional-Development.aspx)  (GPS), and categorized into Communication, Personal Effectiveness, Teaching Competency and Research-Related Skills. Completing enough courses will earn you a GPS notation on your transcript. Highlights for astronomy students include

- Oral Presentation Skills (for Native and Non-Native Speakers of English)
- Understanding the Research Article: Reading Towards Writing
- Let's Talk Science: Introduction to Science Outreach
- Writing NSERC Proposals
- Time Management
- Prewriting Strategies for Developing and Organizing Your Ideas
- Teaching Fundamental Certificate and the Advanced University Teaching Preparation Certificate (see the [TATP](#teaching-assistant-training-program) section for more information on these)
- Effective Journal Research for Graduate Students and Faculty
- Introduction to Data and Information Visualization
- Introduction to Research Management
- Online Tools for Organizing your Research

Sadly there are no links to these courses, as they are offered only sporadically. Checking the GPS link above will reveal the scheduled programming for the upcoming academic year.

## Public Services

### [Service Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/corporate/portfolio/service-canada.html)
Service Canada provides a contact point for federal government services so you don't need to apply by mail. You can visit a branch to apply for a Social Insurance Number (SIN) or renew a Canadian passport. The nearest Service Canada locations to campus are

- [559 College Street](https://maps.google.com/?q=559+College+Street&entry=gmail&source=g)
- [100 Queen Street West](https://maps.google.com/?q=100+Queen+Street+West&entry=gmail&source=g)
- [25 St Clair Avenue East](https://maps.google.com/?q=25+St+Clair+Avenue+East+(St.+Clair+Avenue&entry=gmail&source=g)) 

### [Service Ontario](https://www.ontario.ca/page/serviceontario)
Service Ontario provides a contact point for provincial government services like driver's license renewal and health card applications. The nearest Service Ontario locations to campus are

- [777 Bay Street](https://goo.gl/maps/T31rgMt4hTt)
- [33 Victoria Street](https://goo.gl/maps/Sth1GacDvHC2)
- [839 Yonge Street](https://goo.gl/maps/PXGf5buEXvB2)

### [Toronto Public Library](https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca)

As they say, having fun isn't hard if you have a library card. The [UofT Library](#uoft-library) can certainly meet your academic needs, but the TPL has more on offer than astronomy text books. Getting a TPL card requires proof that you live at a Toronto address (addressed mail to where you live will do), and once you have one it's good for a year. The card gives you access to the TPL's enormous catalogue, including their collection of ebooks,  digital newspapers, and audiobooks. But in addition to this traditional library offerings, the TPL offers access to 'digital innovation hubs', where you can use 3D printers, digital design workstations and recording studios. They also have a partnership with the Toronto Tool Library for all of your tinkering needs. The TPL also offers plenty of programming to give you a chance to pick up a new skill or hone an old one, so there's no reason not to get a card. However, if all of this blatant fawning hasn't convinced you you, you can still work in any of the 100 branches. I can certainly attest to the fact that the atmosphere in the Toronto Reference Library at Yonge and Bloor is much more positive than that in Robarts.

## Things to do in Toronto

### [The Royal Ontario Museum](https://www.rom.on.ca/en)
Canada's largest museum is a marvel inside and out - the interesting architechtural choices made for this building are best experienced in person. The special exhibitions bring extra variety to the usual displays on the museum's four floors. The geology exhibit is a close favourite of mine, but locals will have fond memories of the bat cave, and the new dinosaur exhibit can't help but impress. If you want to take a look, visit on a Tuesday with your student card for free entry. The museum is easily accessible from the Line 1 subway Museum Station, or by a 10 minute walk from the DAA.

### [The Art Gallery of Ontario](https://ago.ca)

This art gallery is another architechtural marvel, and is embedded in a neighbourhood of other smaller galleries and art stores. Arrive after 6pm on a Wednesday for free admission (no student id required!). The AGO curates a huge selection of classical and modern art in its light filled space, although my personal highlight is the collection of model ships in the basement. The AGO is easily reachable by the 505 Dundas streetcar line or by walking from St Patrick Station on the Line 1 subway. It's also only a 10 minute walk from the DAA.

### [The Don Valley Park](https://donrivervalleypark.ca/park-map/)
If big city living has you hungry for greenery, look no farther than the Don River Valley Park. While Don Valley in casual conversation almost exclusively refers to the major highway that runs along the valley, the park is surprisingly tranquil. There is an extensive trail system suitable for walking or cycling, and at the right time of year you can visit the river to see the salmon run. At the south end of the park you can visit [Riverdale Farm](https://www.toronto.ca/explore-enjoy/parks-gardens-beaches/zoos-farms/riverdalefarm/), a working farm hosting beautiful gardens, historic buildings, and a pig and poultry barn. In the north you can find the [Evergreen Brick Works](https://www.evergreen.ca/evergreen-brick-works/), a former brick making factory that now hosts a variety of events to encourage sustainability, including regular markets, swap meets and art exhibitions. The Evergreen Brick Works runs a shuttle from the Line 2 subway Broadway Station, but one can also walk down into the valley from the Line 2 subway Castle Frank Station.


### [The PATH](http://torontopath.com/path-map/)

The ultimate test of your navigational abilities, the PATH will take only the hardiest souls to their intended destinations. Much of Toronto's business district is connected by underground tunnels filled with shops, food courts, and desperately turned around tourists. Hop off the Line 1 subway at any station south of Queen St and follow the signs for the PATH to start exploring.

### [The Eaton Centre](https://www.cfshops.com/toronto-eaton-centre.html)

Sitting between the Times Square wannabe of Yonge and Dundas Square to the North and Nathan Phillips Square to the South, this mall is equipped to help you shop until well after your standard dropping point with four floors of retail, and two food courts. If you feel the need to step outside, there are good odds that either of the bounding squares are hosting an event; if nothing else the strange alien spaceship of Toronto's new City Hall is worth a look. Nearer to the mall you can also find the [Toronto Public Labyrinth](http://www.labyrinthnetwork.ca/toronto-public-labyrinth/). You can easily reach the mall by taking the Line 1 subway to Queen or Dundas stations.

### [Roundhouse Park and CN Tower](https://goo.gl/maps/3oZbcarwnRr)

If you've seen one Toronto sizzle reel, this area was probably heavily featured. Surrounded by glass walled condos, the Roundhouse Park is easy walking distance from the [SkyDome](https://www.mlb.com/bluejays/tickets) (now often known by the inferior moniker *The Rogers Centre*), the [Air Canada Centre](https://www.aircanadacentre.com) (go Raptors!),  [Ripley's Aquarium](https://www.ripleyaquariums.com), [Steamwhistle Breweries](https://steamwhistle.ca), and of course, the [CN Tower](http://www.cntower.ca/en-ca/home.html) (it's 553 m tall, if you read the [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)). This area is a short walk from Union Station at the bottom of the Line 1 subway or from the 510 Spadina and 509 Harbourfront streetcar lines.

### [The Harbourfront Centre](http://www.harbourfrontcentre.com)

Just steps to the south of the Roundhouse park awaits a smorgasbord of free artistic offerings spread along Toronto's waterfront. Two free art galleries, a winter skating rink and summer artisan markets make this area worth a visit at any time of the year. It's easily reachable by foot from Union Station at the bottom of the Line 1 subway or more directly by the 510 Spadina or 509 Harbourfront streetcar lines.

### [Toronto Islands](http://www.torontoisland.com)

The islands are a surprising escape from the city only a 15 minute ferry ride away from the bustling downtown core. Centre Island is often considered the jewel of the bunch, with public picnic sights, Centreville amusement park (including a petting zoo) and the massive Lake Ontario Pedestrian Pier. However, Centre Island ferries only travel in the summer months, but Ward's Island ferries sail year-round to service the residents of the island. Visiting Ward's Island in the spring and fall is my preferred way to visit the lake while avoiding the crowds that throng Centre Island in the summer. You can also visit Hanlan's Point in the summer for this effect, with the added bonus of the option of visiting the clothing optional beach. You can reach the ferry to the islands by walking south from Union Station at the bottom of the Line 1 subway or by taking the 510 Spadina or 509 Harbourfront streetcar lines.

### [High Park](http://www.highparktoronto.com)

The only park in Toronto that I've visited that you can get in deep enough to lose sight of the city. High Park is a massive green space to the west of the city. In addition to the wilder woods of the off-leash dog park, you can enjoy more cultivated gardens as well as the ever popular spring cherry blossoms. The park also includes numerous sports fields, picnic areas and mini zoo (with free admission). The park can be reached from the Line 2 High Park station, or by the 506 Carlton or 508 Lakeshore streetcar lines.

### [Ontario Science Centre](https://www.ontariosciencecentre.ca)

Located north of the city centre, the Science Centre offers everyone an opportunity to get hands on with science. Despite my feelings being biased by the frankly horrifying human body exhibit I was forced to witness as a child, I still find myself able to enjoy the virtual koi pond, the kinetic experiment room, and the rainforest exhibit. The Science Centre had virtual reality eagle flight before it was trendy and also boasts a full sized IMAX theatre. The Science Centre can be reached by taking the Line 1 subway to Eglinton station, followed by a bus, or by taking the Line 2 subway to Pape Station, also followed by a bus.

### [Scarborough Bluffs](https://www.toronto.ca/explore-enjoy/parks-gardens-beaches/scarborough-bluffs/)

Travel far enough east and stick to the lake and you'll encounter the towering Scarborough Bluffs. Majestic in their slow motion crumble, the parks around their base are externally popular with adventurers and wedding photographers alike. In addition to the surrounding trails, you can find the Rosetta McClain gardens at the top of the bluffs and a restaurant at their base. You can reach the bluffs by taking the Line 2 subway to either Warden or Kennedy Station, followed by a bus.
